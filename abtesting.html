                    The task given to users is to fill the shopping cart with at least $150 worth of items regardless of the version of Interface they are given. I collected 38 users data in total. 26 of them came from my peers in the UIUX class, and the remaining data came from my friends.

                 <p class = "text">
                    38 users' data are collected in total, and 7 of them are deleted (see the following paragraph for details). The remaining 31 data are then used to run statistical tests
                    <li class = "text">
                    Deleted 5 users that didnâ€™t do anything except for refreshing the page

                    Deleted 2 user because the items that he or she put into the shopping cart worth way under $150

                    <li class = "text">
                    If some user performed the same test on the same version for more than one time, only the first trial that met the $150 threshold is kept. The remaining trials are disregarded because that user may already have some familiarity with the interface when performing the test for the second time.

                    1. I think the one of the limitations that could affect my test is the amount of the cleaned data I have. After cleaning, I only have 31 users' data in total. 16 from interfacee A and 15 from interface B.
                </p>

                    2. As for my results, since they are not significant, I fail to reject the null hypothesis. I guess this doesn't really tell me much about any design principle. However, before working on this assignment, I didn't expect I have to deleted that much data in the data cleaning process. Taking this as a lesson, I would try to collect more data next time.
