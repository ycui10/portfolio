                    A poor design brought users pain. There are many interfaces/products that we are so used to using them in an certain way that we overlook the fact that the designs could be improved.

                    In this project, I observed and interviewed 3 users using an everyday product: a microwave in my house. <br>
                    <b> Key findings </b>: none of the users had ever used the mode buttons for reheating and disinfecting on this microwave.

                    I created user personas and storyboard focusing on the reasons that they are reluctant to use the modes. Hope this provide some insights on how to improve the design.

                    Microwave is a product we all use on a daily basis. The tasks that users perform on a microwave donâ€™t have many variations, so I never expected the way that users interact with a microwave could be so much different from one and other. Some users set the time precisely so that they could multitask while the microwave is working, while other users choose to set a time that is convenient and efficient for their operations. To my surprise, none of the users I interviewed select corresponding modes when they are using a microwave, while the modes take up a big chunk of space on the interface.
