                    After choosing a startup, reach.live, which we want to design for. We came up with four different sketches that help
                    visualize our idea and weigh the benefits of alternative designs. We then created a lo-fi prototype and a hi-fi prototype
                    based on the sketches.

                    This project was an invaluable opportunity for us to practice the entire iterative design process, from ideation, wire framing, prototyping, to evaluation. By merging everyone’s differing sketches and making improvements based on critiques from classmates and industry experts, we learned various good practices of designing a clear, intuitive interface such as the importance of a coherent visual identity and clear navigation.
